# About

Image classification is the task of identifying images and categorizing them in one of several predefined distinct classes.

Being one of the computer vision (CV) tasks, Image classification serves as the foundation for solving different CV problems such as object detection which further gets divided into semantic and instance segmentation.

The leading architecture used for image recognition and detection tasks is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Convolutional neural networks consist of several layers with small neuron collections, each of them perceiving small parts of an image.

An instant impression is made with the first bite of a new food or taste of drink. Sensory analysis takes us past this first response, examining how the food's properties stimulate each of our senses through: the appearance of food – using sight, hearing and touch. the flavour of food – using smell and taste.
