# About

Class of machine learning algorithms that work on externally supplied instances(data)
in form of predictor and associated target values.
They produce a model representing alternate hypothesis 
i.e. distribution of class labels in terms of predictor variables in feature space.
The model thus generated is used to make predictions
about future instances where the predictor feature values are known but the target value is unknown.

Linear regression model is most basic form fits a straight line to the response variable. 
The model is designed to fit a line that minimizes the squared differences.
